# 🍽️ Restaurant Web

Welcome to the **Restaurant Website** project! This repository contains the source code for my very first basic project, a responsive and user-friendly restaurant website. The site showcases various sections typical for a restaurant's online presence, including menus, locations, galleries, and contact information.

## 📖 Overview

* **HTML5**: Structuring the content semantically.

The website is designed to provide visitors with an engaging experience, highlighting the restaurant's offerings and ambiance.

## 🧾 Features

* **Home Page**: Introduction to the restaurant with featured highlights.

* **Menu Page**: Detailed list of food items available.
* **Gallery Page**: Visual showcase of dishes and restaurant interiors.
